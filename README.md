#IS 542 Semester Final Project

### Author - Jordan Widdison

## Technologies

The main framework that this application is built in is Ruby on Rails.  There is a MySQL database that holds calendar information.  
The app and the database are both hosted on Heroku's free tier, so when you visit the URL where they're hosted ( https://jazzcollectivecalendar.herokuapp.com/calendar/index ) it might take a few seconds to 'wake up' the instances.

On top of Rails, this application uses SASS to pre-compile CSS.  I had never really used SASS before and have started learning it to complete this project.  It also uses Slim, which is an abbreviated and lightweight templating engine built for ruby and specifically for rails applications.  (See http://slim-lang.com/)

## Project Requirements

I have written a fair amount of both HTML (in .html.slim files) and CSS (in .scss files) to meet those requirements for this project.  The main funcitonality of the app is to display a web-based collaborative calendar for the Jazz Collective of Utah.
